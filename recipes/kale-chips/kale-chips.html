					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Crispy, savory, light...is it better than a potato chip? Indubitably, yes.</p>
					<p>The kale chip. We start with the greenest, strongest kale leaves. Give them a cleaning and rubbing worthy of their royalty. Bake them low and slow. Et ouila! The result is a batch of green, seasoned kale chips crunchy enough for ASMR and delicious enough to devour the entire batch.</p>

			<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat oven to 285 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>Thoroughly clean kale, brushing with soft bamboo bristles and rinsing with water until kale is free of any dead spots, dirt, bugs.</li>
				<li>Pat leaves dry and divide, removing middle stem and tearing into palm sized pieces.</li>
				<li>Rub with evoo, salt, and light portion of each: garlic powder, smoked paprika, turmeric, cumin, curry.</li>
				<li>Carefully line kale chips along baking sheet, pushing leaves into baking sheet corners and into other pieces of kales just enough to cover all surfaces of the baking sheet. (It's okay to smush the pieces but not too much that it doesn't chip, but balls.)</li>
				<li>Lightly season again, adding nutritional yeast and roasted red pepper flakes.</li>
